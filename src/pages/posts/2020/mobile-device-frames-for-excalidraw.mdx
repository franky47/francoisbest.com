title: Mobile Device Frames For Excalidraw
description: Building mobile UI mockups in Excalidraw is a lot of fun, but eye-balling screen ratios is not great. Here are some free resources to help you get started, and a guide on how to make your own frames.

import { Button } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { FiFileText } from 'react-icons/fi'
import { DiApple, DiAndroid } from 'react-icons/di'
import MobileMockup from 'src/../public/images/posts/2020/mobile-device-frames-for-excalidraw/mobile-mockup.svg'

I love using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw) to build UI mockups. As I was
working with a client on a responsive version of their webapp, I realised that
I was always eye-balling the screen dimensions, and I wanted a way to make the
screen ratio closer to the final deal.

<figure style={{ marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
  <MobileMockup
    role="img"
    className="excalidraw darkModeInvertLuminosity"
    aria-label="A UI mockup for a product landing page on an iPhone 8"
  />

      Excalidraw
    </a>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Figma has frame size presets for various devices, which is a great feature when paired
with responsive layouts and other design tools. None of that is needed for
mockups. It would bring unnecessary complexity to a tool that needs to remain simple,
but at least having the option to set a rectangle to the dimensions of a given
device would be cool.

So I set out to build my own library of device frames, which are simply rectangles
with the right aspect ratio for each device.

## TL;DR

Here are the links to the Excalidraw resources:

<Button
  as="a"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
  colorScheme="accent"
  href="https://excalidraw.com/#json=5632680284651520,5Gocwea8NCsAOk6uVupJ6w"
  leftIcon={<DiApple />}
  w={['100%', 'auto']}
  mb={[2, 8]}
  mr={[0, 2]}
>
  Apple Device Frames
</Button>

<Button
  colorScheme="accent"
  isDisabled
  leftIcon={<DiAndroid />}
  w={['100%', 'auto']}
  mb={8}
>
  Android Device Frames
</Button>

## Making Your Own Frames

We are going to use the following tools:

- [Figma](https://figma.com) _<small>(free)</small>_
- [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/) _<small>(paid, but worth every penny)</small>_

From Figma, we create a frame for a given device, say an iPhone 8, with a vivid
background colour:

<Image
  src="/images/posts/2020/mobile-device-frames-for-excalidraw/figma-frame-iphone8.jpg"
  alt="iPhone 8 frame in Figma with red background"
  shadow="xl"
/>

Copy the frame as a PNG image:

```
Right click > Copy/Paste > Copy as PNG
```

Then we're going to import the frame image to CleanShot:

<Image
  src="/images/posts/2020/mobile-device-frames-for-excalidraw/cleanshot-import.jpg"
  alt="CleanShot > Open from Clipboard"
  shadow="xl"
/>

Now we can use the overlay feature by pinning the frame image to the screen:

<Image
  src="/images/posts/2020/mobile-device-frames-for-excalidraw/cleanshot-pin.jpg"
  alt="Click the 'Pin to the screen' icon in the lower left corner"
  shadow="xl"
/>

import { GoLightBulb } from 'react-icons/go'

<Note title="CleanShot Feature Request" icon={GoLightBulb}>
  <em>
    If anyone from CleanShot reads this post, a feature to use the clipboard
    image as a source for the "Pin to the Screen" menu action would save an
    extra step here.
  </em>
</Note>

In Excalidraw, we can now position our overlay frame image and draw a rectangle
that follows the same ratio:

<video
  autoPlay
  loop
  muted
  playsInline
  style={{ marginBottom: '4rem', borderRadius: '4px' }}
>
  <source
    src="/images/posts/2020/mobile-device-frames-for-excalidraw/make-frame.webm"
    type="video/webm; codecs=vp9,vorbis"
  />
  <source
    src="/images/posts/2020/mobile-device-frames-for-excalidraw/make-frame.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
  <div>
    <em>
      Damn, there was supposed to be a video here, but your browser doesn't
      support it, so here's what it shows:
    </em>
    <ul>
      <li>Change the overlay opacity to 50%</li>
      <li>Move it over the Excalidraw canvas</li>
      <li>
        Select the Rectangle tool in Excalidraw and draw a rectangle around the
        frame overlay
      </li>
      <li>Position the overlay so that it fits a corner of the rectangle</li>
      <li>Adjust the other corner of the rectangle to match the ratio</li>
      <li>Voilà!</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</video>
