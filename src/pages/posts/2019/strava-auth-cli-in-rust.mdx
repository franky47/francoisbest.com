I use the Strava API to develop a little web app called
[Stravels](https://pwa.stravels.io).
It requires authentication tokens, which are obtained in the classic OAuth
flow way:

1. Visit a login page on the provider's domain (Strava), passing the app ID.
2. Log into the provider's system
3. Arrive to the authorization page, where you can:
   - Authorize the whole app for the permissions it requested
   - Or a subset of permissions
   - Or deny the access altogether
4. The page then redirects you to a URL with a query parameter containing a code.
5. You must then do a token exchange by sending this code to the Strava API
   and they will give you a pair of tokens (refresh and access) in exchange.

## Tools Against DRY

In order to play with the Strava API, I found myself having to build the
login page first in my prototypes, complete with handling the redirection.
This is not ideal, as this code would likely be thrown away when implementing
the actual authentication view, and it slows down the "idea to prototype" phase,
so the situation called for a better tool to obtain tokens easily
to do quick exploratory API calls.

Services with OAuth APIs usually provide you with a test token in their web UI,
but Strava's has a limited scope which made it hard to painlessly explore the
full API.

I recently started learning Rust, and was looking for something to build with
it. This sounds like the perfect excuse.

## Getting Started

Here's what we want:

1. A command-line utility (no need for a web app or even a fancy UI)
2. That takes basic information as input
3. That lets you login and authorize the app
4. And gives you back the access and refresh tokens

Point #1 gives us the development context, we need a Rust binary:

```shell
$ cargo init strava-auth --bin
$ cd strava-auth
```

<Note title="Note">
  <em>
    I won't be focusing on how to install Rust, what it is or how to use Cargo,
    there's plenty of documentation out there already.
  </em>
</Note>

### Dependencies

We are going to split the program into four parts, where we will need to:

1. Parse command line arguments
2. Open a URL into the default browser
3. Start a web server on localhost to handle the redirection
4. Make HTTP requests to the Strava API

Fortunately, the [Rust ecosystem](https://crates.io) has everything we need:

```shell
$ cargo add structopt webbrowser rocket reqwest
```

      <code>cargo-edit</code>
    </OutgoingLink>
    .
  </em>
</Note>

Here's a recap of our dependencies:

- [`structopt`](https://crates.io/crates/structopt) handles CLI arguments parsing and validation
- [`webbrowser`](https://crates.io/crates/webbrowser) opens URLs in the default browser
- [`rocket`](https://crates.io/crates/rocket) is an awesome web server
- [`reqwest`](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest) sends HTTP requests

Before going further, we're going to need to use the nightly version of Rust,
as required by Rocket (at the time of writing):

```shell
$ rustup override set nightly
```

## Strategy

Before jumping into the code, here's what we're going to do:

1. Get the info we need from the command line
2. Build the authorization URL to open in the browser
3. Start a web server that listens on localhost for the redirection

According to the [Strava authentication documentation](https://developers.strava.com/docs/authentication/#request-access),
we need the client ID and secret, which can be found for our Strava
app [in the settings](https://www.strava.com/settings/api).

We'll pass the client ID and secret to our CLI like this:

```shell
$ strava-auth --id 123456 --secret 0123456789abcdef
```

## Command Line Arguments

Parsing command line arguments (and validating, and displaying help, and all
the perks of user interaction) is made easier with
[`structopt`](https://docs.rs/structopt/):

```rust:main.rs
use structopt::StructOpt;

#[derive(Debug, StructOpt)]
#[structopt(name = "strava-auth")]
/// Authorize and authenticate a Strava API app.
///
/// Requires a GUI web browser to be available.
struct Arguments {
  #[structopt(short = "i")]
  id: u32,

  #[structopt(short = "s")]
  secret: String,
}

fn main() {
  let args = Arguments::from_args();
  println!("{:#?}", args);
}
```

Let's test it:

```shell
$ cargo run -- --id 123456 --secret 0123456789abcdef
```

<Note title="Did you know ?" status="info">
  <em>
    The <code>--</code> after <code>cargo run</code> is a Unix trick to pass the
    arguments to our program and not to cargo itself.
  </em>
</Note>

We should get the following output:

```shell
Arguments {
    id: 123456,
    secret: "0123456789abcdef"
}
```

## Building The Authorization URL

The specification for the url format is given by the
[Strava authentication documentation](https://developers.strava.com/docs/authentication/#request-access).

We'll use the web version: `https://www.strava.com/oauth/authorize`.

By default we'll also request all the possible scopes, as we can manually
authorize them individually in the authorization page. Strava sends us
back the approved scopes in the redirection URL, so we'll display them as an
output to the user in addition to the tokens.

For the `redirect_uri`, we'll use `localhost` as it's where our listening
server will be. Luckily, it's whitelisted by Strava for local development,
so no need to mess with the OAuth redirection whitelist in the settings
there.

Here's what the code looks like:

```rust:main.rs
fn make_strava_auth_url(client_id: u32) -> String {
  let scopes = [
    // "read", // Shadowed by read_all
    "read_all",
    "profile:read_all",
    "profile:write",
    // "activity:read", // Shadowed by activity:read_all
    "activity:read_all",
    "activity:write",
  ]
  .join(",");

  let params = [
    format!("client_id={}", client_id),
    String::from("redirect_uri=http://localhost:8000"),
    String::from("response_type=code"),
    String::from("approval_prompt=auto"),
    format!("scope={}", scopes),
  ]
  .join("&");
  format!("https://www.strava.com/oauth/authorize?{}", params)
}
```

Now we can use this function and pass the generated URL to
[`webbrowser`](https://github.com/amodm/webbrowser-rs) to open it in the
default browser:

```rust:main.rs
use webbrowser;

// ...

fn main() {
  let args = Arguments::from_args();

  let auth_url = make_strava_auth_url(args.id);
  if webbrowser::open(&auth_url).is_err() {
    // Try manually
    println!("Visit the following URL to authorize your app with Strava:");
    println!("{}\n", auth_url);
  }
}
```

Here we can see an example of how good error handling is in Rust: rather than
calling `.unwrap()` on the result of `webbrowser::open()` and crash if it
failed to find a suitable browser to open the URL in, we provide a fallback
by showing it to the user and letting them open it manually.

This is ideal, because just showing them an error message they can't do much about
provides zero value and a lot of frustration, whereas a manual action keeps the
process going.

Let's test what we've done so far.

```shell
$ cargo run -- --id <your-app-id> --secret <your-app-secret>
```

You should get something like this in your browser:

<WideContainer>
  <img
    src="/images/posts/2019/strava-auth-cli-in-rust/strava-auth-page.png"
    alt="Strava authorization page"
  />
</WideContainer>

At this point, if you click either Authorize or Cancel, you'll get an `Unable to connect`
error, as there is no server to handle the redirect.

## Adding The Server

Spinning a web server is made easy with [Rocket](https://rocket.rs). To keep
things tidy, we'll implement the server in a separate file `server.rs`.

We're going to define two routes, one for a successful redirection (which
contains a code and a list of approved scopes), and one for redirection
errors:

```rust:server.rs
use rocket::config::{Config, Environment, LoggingLevel};
use rocket::http::RawStr;

#[get("/?<code>&<scope>")]
fn success(code: &RawStr, scope: &RawStr) -> &'static str {
  println!("Code: {}", code);
  println!("Scope: {}", scope);
  "âœ… You may close this browser tab and return to the terminal."
}

#[get("/?<error>", rank = 2)]
fn error(error: &RawStr) -> String {
  println!("{}", error);
  format!("Error: {}, please return to the terminal.", error)
}
```

Rocket lets us define routes based on the presence of query parameters, and
will do the routing for us. However, as both paths are `/`, we need to tell
Rocket to try the success route first, then the error one if either `code`
or `scope` is missing. This is done with [ranking](https://rocket.rs/v0.4/guide/requests/#forwarding).

If the redirect contains both query parameters of `code` and `scopes`, the
first handler `success` will be called, otherwise an `error` query parameter
should be there, and the second handler `error` will be called.

If neither is present, then we'll get a 404 error (but we don't care since
the problem would be on Strava's side).

In both case, we print the parameters to the terminal, and return a string
as a response that will be visible in the browser, instructing the user to
return to the terminal.

## Starting The Server

Let's add a function to `server.rs` to start the Rocket server:

```rust:server.rs
pub fn start() {
  let config = Config::build(Environment::Development)
    .log_level(LoggingLevel::Off)
    .finalize()
    .unwrap();
  rocket::custom(config)
    .mount("/", routes![success, error])
    .launch();
}
```

Most of the complexity here is to create a custom configuration for Rocket
that suppresses logging to the console, as we don't care much for its
internals in this case.

Let's move back to `main.rs`:

```rust:main.rs
// Required for Rocket code generation to work
#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]

#[macro_use]
extern crate rocket;

mod server; // Include our `server.rs` file

// ...

fn main() {
  let args = Arguments::from_args();
  let auth_url = make_strava_auth_url(args.id);
  if webbrowser::open(&auth_url).is_err() {
    // Try manually
    println!("Visit the following URL to authorize your app with Strava:");
    println!("{}\n", auth_url);
  }

  server::start();
}
```

## A Case For Multithreading

By default, Rocket's `launch()` method will block the thread it's running on
to wait for requests, indefinitely, and never return.

This is not ideal, as we're going to have to continue doing stuff once the
redirection has succeeded (or failed), and moving that logic into the route
handlers would not be recommended: it would duplicate some logic, make the
whole program hard to reason about and the code even harder to read without
knowing the data flow.

Fortunately, Rust is great for multithreaded applications. So we're going to
start the web server in a separate thread, and have it communicate with the
main thread with an `mpsc` channel (there's many multithreading crates in the
ecosystem, but the standard library will do just fine here).

Since many things can happen that the server may want to report, we'll start
by defining some data structures to exchange:

```rust:server.rs
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct AuthInfo {
  pub code: String,
  pub scopes: Vec<String>,
}

impl AuthInfo {
  pub fn new(code: &RawStr, scopes: &RawStr) -> Self {
    Self {
      code: String::from(code.as_str()),
      scopes: scopes.as_str().split(",").map(String::from).collect(),
    }
  }
}
```

When everything goes well, the route handler will send an `AuthInfo` struct
back to the main thread, that contains the authorization code and the
approved scopes.

Still, we need a single type to send through the channel, and as things can
go wrong, let's use a classic Rust construct, `Result`:

```rust
pub type AuthResult = Result<AuthInfo, String>;
```

Our errors can be strings for now, as there's not much interest to strongly
type them at this point.

## Passing Data Across Threads

Since we're going to start our web server in a different thread, we need a
way to pass data between the route handler's thread and the main thread.

Rust does that through [`mpsc` channels](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/).
We're going to create a transmitter (`tx`) and a receiver (`rx`), keep the
`rx` in the main thread and pass the transmitter to the server thread.

This is what it would look like _(spoiler alert: this code won't compile yet)_ :

```rust:main.rs
use std::sync::mpsc;

fn main() {
  // ...

  let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
  std::thread::spawn(move || {
    server::start(tx);
  });

  // recv() is blocking, so the main thread will patiently
  // wait for data to be sent through the channel.
  // This way the server thread stays alive for as long as
  // it's needed.
  match rx.recv().unwrap() {
    Ok(auth_info) => {
      // Do something with the result
    }
    Err(error) => eprintln!("{}", error),
  }
}
```

```rust:server.rs
use std::sync::mpsc;

// ...

pub type Transmitter = mpsc::Sender<AuthResult>;

pub fn start(tx: Transmitter) {
  // How do we pass tx to the route handlers ?
}
```

## Data-Race Freedom

You know how everyone says Rust is data-race free ? We're about to witness an
example.

Rocket uses multiple threads to parallelise request handling. Even though we
are only going to handle a single request, Rust is here to let us know that
things could go wrong when passing data from the route handler back to the
main thread.

As we don't have a way to clone our `tx` when Rocket spawns its worker
threads, we're going to use a Mutex instead (performance is not a critical
feature here).

We're also going to reduce the number of worker threads to 1, even if it does
not magically bring back thread safety, it will at least avoid unnecessary
thread creation.

To pass the Mutex, we'll use Rocket's managed state facility. Here's what
our updated `server.rs` looks like:

```rust:server.rs
use rocket::State;
use std::sync::Mutex;

// ...

pub type TxMutex<'req> = State<'req, Mutex<Transmitter>>;

// --

#[get("/?<code>&<scope>")]
fn success(code: &RawStr, scope: &RawStr, tx_mutex: TxMutex) -> &'static str {
  let tx = tx_mutex.lock().unwrap();
  tx.send(Ok(AuthInfo::new(code, scope))).unwrap();
  "âœ… You may close this browser tab and return to the terminal."
}

#[get("/?<error>", rank = 2)]
fn error(error: &RawStr, tx_mutex: TxMutex) -> String {
  let tx = tx_mutex.lock().unwrap();
  tx.send(Err(String::from(error.as_str()))).unwrap();
  format!("Error: {}, please return to the terminal.", error)
}

// --

pub fn start(tx: Transmitter) {
  let config = Config::build(Environment::Development)
    .log_level(LoggingLevel::Off)
    .workers(1) // No need for multithreading here
    .finalize()
    .unwrap();

  rocket::custom(config)
    .mount("/", routes![success, error])
    .manage(Mutex::new(tx))
    .launch();
}
```

## Authenticating With The Strava API

If everything goes right, we should now have access to an authorization
code, yay ! Let's now turn it into a token.

The [Strava documentation](https://developers.strava.com/docs/authentication/#token-exchange)
tells us what to do:

```rust:strava.rs
use std::collections::HashMap;

pub fn exchange_token(code: &str, id: u32, secret: &str) {
  let client = reqwest::Client::new();
  let mut body = HashMap::new();
  body.insert("client_id", format!("{}", id));
  body.insert("client_secret", String::from(secret));
  body.insert("code", String::from(code));
  body.insert("grant_type", String::from("authorization_code"));
  let res = client
    .post("https://www.strava.com/oauth/token")
    .json(&body)
    .send()
    .unwrap()
    .error_for_status()
    .unwrap();
  println!("{:#?}", res);
}
```

```rust:main.rs

mod strava;

fn main() {
  // ...

  match rx.recv().unwrap() {
    Ok(auth_info) => {
      strava::exchange_token(&auth_info.code,
                             args.id,
                             &args.secret);
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Parsing And Displaying The Result

The result we get is that of the response given back by the Strava API. What
we need is actually in the body, which is a piece of JSON.

We can tell Rust to validate that response against a format and make it into
a native object using `serde` (and its friends `serde_json` and
`serde_derive`).

```shell
$ cargo add serde serde_json serde_derive
```

```rust:main.rs
#[macro_use]
extern crate serde_derive;
```

```rust:strava.rs
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
pub struct Login {
  pub access_token: String,
  pub refresh_token: String,
}

pub type LoginResult = Result<Login, reqwest::Error>;

pub fn exchange_token(code: &str, id: u32, secret: &str) -> LoginResult {
  let mut body = HashMap::new();
  body.insert("client_id", format!("{}", id));
  body.insert("client_secret", String::from(secret));
  body.insert("code", String::from(code));
  body.insert("grant_type", String::from("authorization_code"));
  let mut res = reqwest::Client::new()
    .post("https://www.strava.com/oauth/token")
    .json(&body)
    .send()?
    .error_for_status()?;
  Ok(res.json()?)
}
```

We can now finish the program and display the login data in `main.rs`:

```rust:main.rs
// ...

fn main() {
  // ...

  match rx.recv().unwrap() {
    Ok(auth_info) => {
      match strava::exchange_token(&auth_info.code,
                                   args.id,
                                   &args.secret) {
        Ok(login) => {
          println!("{:#?}", login);
          println!("Scopes {:#?}", auth_info.scopes);
        }
        Err(error) => eprintln!("Error: {:#?}", error),
      }
    }
    Err(error) => eprintln!("{}", error),
  }
}
```

## Lifetime Issues

In the case where something wrong happens, we have a problem: the main thread
exits too quickly, and along with it goes the server thread, which does not
have enough time to send its response to the browser. So instead of our nice
error message, we see a "Connection reset" error.. :/

We don't have this issue on the happy path, as the request to the Strava API
likely adds a little delay before the program exits, and lets the server send
the response.

It would be nice if we could let the server respond properly, then kill the
program. We can do so by adding a small delay in the main thread if an error
occurs:

```rust
match rx.recv().unwrap() {
  Ok(auth_info) => {
    // ...
  }
  Err(error) => {
    eprintln!("{}", error);
    // Let the async server send its response
    // before the main thread exits.
    std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(1));
  }
}
```

## Closing Notes

While this project is not an example of Rust's best practices (in term of error
handling, thread synchronization, logging etc..), it shows how straightforward
it can be to build a quick prototyping tool to solve a pain point in Rust, by
leveraging the safety of the language and the diversity of the ecosystem.
