**End-to-end encrypted** apps _(E2EE)_ use cryptographic keys that are generated in
the client, and never sent to the server in clear-text. This is what makes the
strength of this architecture: **the server never has the key**.

Keys are usually generated from credentials provided by the user, such as
a username and a password, which are derived into a strong cryptographic key using
key-derivation functions:

Since the key never leaves the client, it needs to be stored there.

We can't reasonably ask the user to enter their credentials every time we need the
key to encrypt/decrypt something, it would be a terrible UX and it would lead to
users picking weaker passwords.

Let's have a look at what some E2EE apps do, by analyzing the
[ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) approach.

## Key Lifetime

The first thing to define is the lifetime of the key.
For browser-based applications, keys usually last as long as the session.

This rules out `localStorage`, `Indexed DB` and cookies, but we could use
`sessionStorage`, or simply keep it in memory only.

## Persistence & Page Reloads

Keeping the key in memory has a serious downside: if your user ever reloads
the page, the key is gone, and you would have to show a login screen again.
Some E2EE apps like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) do this for extra security.

If we want our key to survive page reloads, we need to use some form of storage.

One thing to know however, is that most browsers will
[write](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/89937/is-html5-sessionstorage-secure-for-temporarily-storing-a-cryptographic-key)
the contents of `sessionStorage` to disk when reloading the page.

This is an issue as we don't want the key to leak, and any write to the
filesystem places it outside of our control.

## Divide to Conquer

The approach taken by ProtonMail is to split the key into two parts,
store each part using different techniques, and recompose the key on page load.

To split the key, it is XORed with a buffer of random bytes.
A copy of the original random data is going to be the other part,
so that both of them individually are random, but by XORing them together,
the randomness cancels out and reveals the key:

```txt
# Split
    a = key ^ random
    b = random

# Recompose
    a ^ b
 => (key ^ random) ^ random
 => key ^ (random ^ random)
 => key ^ 0
 => key
```

One part is sent to `sessionStorage`, and the other uses a trick discovered by
[Thomas Frank](https://www.thomasfrank.se) named
[SessionVars](https://www.thomasfrank.se/sessionvars.html).

## `window.name`

There is a `name` property on the global `window` object in the browser.
Its value persists across page reloads, but is not written to disk.

It has been used for [cross-domain communications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/name#Notes),
and because other domains can see its value, we can't send anything there in clear text.

Fortunately, other domains can't access our domain's `sessionStorage`,
so all they would see in `window.name` is random data.

## The Right Amount of Persistence

The key does not need to be saved in those locations at all times however.

Because `window.name` is writable by everyone, it would be easy for attackers
to erase the key if it was stored there as a single source of truth.

Instead, we can keep the key in memory, and only persist the key to those
shared locations when the memory will be destroyed: on page unloads.

If the user reloaded the page, both parts of the key will be preserved
and reassembled on page load. If they closed the tab or the window,
both parts will be erased by the browser (end of the session).

## Cleaning up

Now our key has been recomposed, both storage locations can be cleared
as we don't want our [horcruxes](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Horcrux)
to be left around.

The original implementation of this system is available in ProtonMail's
[shared library](https://github.com/ProtonMail/proton-shared/blob/master/lib/helpers/secureSessionStorage.js#L7).

## Introducing [`session-keystore`](https://github.com/47ng/session-keystore)

<NpmPackage
  pkg="session-keystore"
  repo="47ng/session-keystore"
  accent="text-indigo-500"
  className="my-8"
/>

For all to use this key storage technique without depending on ProtonMail's
internal library, I built [`session-keystore`](https://github.com/47ng/session-keystore),
a TypeScript implementation with a few extra features:

- Key expiration dates
- Multiple stores
- Key access/modification/expiration callbacks for monitoring
