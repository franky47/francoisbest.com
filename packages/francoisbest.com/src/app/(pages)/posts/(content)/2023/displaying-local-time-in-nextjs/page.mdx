You may be familiar with React hydration issues when using Next.js, or other
server-side rendered frameworks:

<Note status="error" title="Uncaught Error">

Text content does not match server-rendered HTML. Server: "foo" Client: "bar"

</Note>

This happens when the server renders something, but the client re-renders it
differently.

Now imagine you want to display a **specific point in time** in your app. This could
be the publication date/time of a comment for example. Your source of data
will likely be a _timestamp_, or be a Date object rooted in _UTC_.

import { LocalDateTime } from 'ui/components/local-time'

Rendering it statically as-is will be impractical for most of your users.
UTC is great for machines, but humans prefer to see times in their **local timezone**.

For example, this post was published on:

- <LocalDateTime
    date={metadata.publicationDate}
    separator=", at "
    hydratedSuffix={
      <>
        {' '}
        in <em>your</em> local time
      </>
    }
  />
- 27 September 2023, at 10:00 in _my_ local time _(Europe/Paris)_
- <code>{metadata.publicationDate}</code> in UTC

We're going to build a React component that deals with that, that works with
Next.js 13.4+ and React 18, in a mix of server and client components.

The local timezone will only be available when rendering on the client, so even if
this is not technically _"interactive"_ content, we'll need to use the
`use client` directive to allow re-rendering a component on the client.

## useHydration

A trick often used to avoid hydration issues is to render the same content on
the server and on the hydration pass, but then trigger a re-render to
update the content when the client has the information we need.

```ts title="hooks/useHydration.ts"
export function useHydration() {
  const [hydrated, setHydrated] = useState(false)
  useEffect(() => {
    setHydrated(true)
  }, [])
  return hydrated
}
```

We can use this signal to render a default value on the server _(eg: the UTC time)_,
and to re-render the component on the client when the local timezone is available.

```tsx title="Initial approach (ðŸš§ does not work yet ðŸš§)" /hydrated/
'use client'

import { useHydration } from 'hooks/useHydration'

export function LocalTime({ date }: { date: Date | string | number }) {
  const hydrated = useHydration()
  return (
    <time dateTime={new Date(date).toISOString()}>
      {new Date(date).toLocaleTimeString()}
      {hydrated ? '' : ' (UTC)'}
    </time>
  )
}
```

<Note status="info" title="Accessibility note">
  The `<time>` element is used here to give accessible information about a specific
  point in time. Its `datetime` attribute can use a UTC-rooted ISO-8601
  timestamp string, which won't change across re-renders.<br/><cite className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">Source: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time)</cite>
</Note>

## Suspense

Simply re-rendering the component is not enough though. In Next.js and with React 18,
this will still cause a hydration mismatch.

We could silence it by slapping a [`suppressHydrationWarning`](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-hydration-error#solution-3-using-suppresshydrationwarning)
prop on the component containing our timestamp, but it's only hiding the problem,
and the resulting rendered time would still be **stuck in UTC**.

The hydration error message actually tells us what to do:

<Note status="error" title="Uncaught Error">
  There was an error while hydrating. Because the error happened **outside of a
  Suspense boundary**, the entire root will switch to client rendering.
</Note>

Wrapping our component in `<Suspense>` will allow us to catch this error
and re-render the component on the client.

Here's what we've got so far:

```tsx title="local-time.tsx" /Suspense/
'use client'

import { Suspense } from 'react'
import { useHydration } from 'hooks/useHydration'

export function LocalTime({ date }: { date: Date | string | number }) {
  const hydrated = useHydration()
  return (
    <Suspense>
      <time dateTime={new Date(date).toISOString()}>
        {new Date(date).toLocaleTimeString()}
        {hydrated ? '' : ' (UTC)'}
      </time>
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

<Note>
  We don't need to specify a `fallback` here since we're rendering children
  synchronously.
</Note>

But.. it **still fails**.

## The `key` to success

I believe the problem is that the `<Suspense>` component is rendered only when
the component is first mounted, and not after the hydration pass.

We can solve this problem and get our final implementation by adding a `key` prop to
the `<Suspense>` component, and connecting it to the `hydrated` value:

```tsx title="local-time.tsx" /key={hydrated ? 'local' : 'utc'}/
'use client'

import { Suspense } from 'react'
import { useHydration } from 'hooks/useHydration'

export function LocalTime({ date }: { date: DateLike }) {
  const hydrated = useHydration()
  return (
    <Suspense key={hydrated ? 'local' : 'utc'}>
      <time dateTime={new Date(date).toISOString()}>
        {new Date(date).toLocaleTimeString()}
        {hydrated ? '' : ' (UTC)'}
      </time>
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

<Note>
  The values for `key` can be anything, as long as they are different when the
  component needs to be re-rendered.
