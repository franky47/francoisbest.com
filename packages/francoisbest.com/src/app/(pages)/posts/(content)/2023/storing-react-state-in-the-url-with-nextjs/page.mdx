Rather than keeping React UI state internal to the application memory, where it is lost on unmount and page reloads,
we can sync it with the [URL query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string).
This opens up a lot of possibilities:

- **Sharing** it with others
- **Bookmarking** it to come back to it later
- **Restoring** it after a page reload or browser crash
- **Navigating** it with the back and forward buttons

Take this example:

import { Demo } from './demo'

<Demo />

A couple of years ago, I wrote a library to do this in Next.js. It's used
by a fair amount of people, including Vercel on their dashboard.

<NpmPackage
  pkg="next-usequerystate"
  repo="47ng/next-usequerystate"
  accent="text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-400"
/>

  Version
  [**1.8.0**](https://github.com/47ng/next-usequerystate/releases/tag/v1.8.0) of
  [`next-usequerystate`](https://47ng/next-usequerystate) now supports the app
  router, in Next.js 13.4+.
</Note>

For it to support the app router, a lot of internal changes were required, due
to some limitations in the Next.js router and the Web History API.

But it payed off, as those changes also gave us:

- Optimal performance (now identical to `React.useState`)
- Batched updates
- SSR in Server Components with correct query values _(no more hydration tricks or errors)_
- Better DX for creating and configuring parsers
- Finer control over options

For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/47ng/next-usequerystate#readme).

This post will focus on a couple of internal tricks on how to store React
state in the URL with Next.js.

## Shallow routing

<Note status="info" title="Definition">
  Shallow routing is when the URL changes, but the page doesn't reload or fetch
  data.
</Note>

The Next.js app router doesn't support shallow routing, as of version 13.4.

This has caused a lot of [frustration](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/48110)
for developpers who want to update query string parameters _without_ triggering
network calls to the server.

It also slowed down initial efforts to port `next-usequerystate` to the app router,
especially when binding a query state to high-frequency sources, like:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```html
<input type="text" />
<input type="range" />
```

To solve these issues, a new direction has been taken: `next-usequerystate` uses
a **shallow mode by default**, and does so by only using the Next.js router
on non-shallow updates.

This is done by tapping directly into the [Web History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API/Working_with_the_History_API)
for shallow updates.

## Batching & Throttling

One issue when connecting `history.replaceState()` to a slider or a text input
is that those APIs are **rate-limited** by the browser.

To avoid hitting the limits, we can **batch** updates and **throttle** them under the
rate limit.

Empirically, a **50ms** throttle seems enough for Firefox, Chrome and Edge.

<Note status="warning" title="Note for Safari users">

Safari has incredibly low limits for this API: **100 calls per 30 seconds**.

While it would be possible to throttle to every ~300ms, detecting Safari to do so
seems like a mine field that I'd rather avoid. If someone is interested in tackling
this issue, please [open a Pull Request](https://github.com/47ng/next-usequerystate/fork),
and I'll happily look into it!

</Note>

Between updates of the URL with `history.{set,replace}State`, we're just **queueing**
updates. Namely:

- The key to update
- The new value, or `null` to remove it from the URL
- The options it requires

import UpdateQueue from './update-queue.svg'

<figure>
  <UpdateQueue
    className="w-full dark:invert dark:hue-rotate-180"
    height={null}
  />
  <figcaption>
    More recent values take precedence in the query resolution
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Keeping track of options in the queue allows overriding the defaults:

- If at least one item in the queue requires a non-shallow update, call the Next.js router.
  Otherwise do a client-only history update.
- If at least one item in the queue requires scrolling to the top, do that. Otherwise don't.
- History is `replaceState` by default, but if one item in the queue requests a `pushState`,
  then the whole update creates a new history entry.

<Note status="warning">
  This last one may cause inconsistencies with state navigation with the back
  button, depending on what is queued alongside the `push` update.
</Note>

## Syncing state

Now that the URL updates asynchronously, we need a way to return a state value
that corresponds to what **will be** stored in the URL. It also needs to play
well with standard Next.js navigation with `<Link>` and imperative routing calls.

Internally, the hooks use an individual React state, which get synced by query key
using an [event emitter](https://github.com/developit/mitt).

This emitter is also used to transmit sync triggers from the history API, when
external navigation occurs _(not query updates)_. This is done by [patching](https://github.com/47ng/next-usequerystate/blob/32c764403b86ced7a676470eb4bce4f5c6697945/src/lib/sync.ts#L28-L81)
the History methods.

To distinguish between internal and external navigation events, we use the
unused `title` second parameter of `replaceState`.

<Note status="info" title={<>A bit of history <small><em>(no pun intended)</em></small></>}>
  This unused parameter was originally intended to change the page title in the
  history stack, but never got good browser support, and was later on marked as
  deprecated.

The [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/replaceState#parameters) for `replaceState` states that this parameter should be
set to an empty string for compatibility with older browsers.

</Note>

We use this to our advantage, and set it to a special marker value when we're
updating the URL internally for query changes. The patched `replaceState` method
can then detect when it's called from the outside _(when the `title` parameter
is **not** equal to our internal marker)_, and trigger a sync.

## Optimising for performance

One advantage of using individual React states per hook is the performance:
updates are synchronously propagated to all hooks, keeping the UI snappy.

There are a couple of tricks to make this work with **state updater functions** though.

If two hooks are updated in the same event loop with SUFs, we want the second one
to be based on the result of the first one, as we would expect the URL to
**eventually** behave:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
const [count, setCount] = useQueryState(
  'count',
  parseAsInteger.withDefault(0)
)

function onClick() {
  setCount(x => x + 1)
  setCount(x => x * 2)
}

// First click: counter = 0
// batch update: counter = 1 (0 + 1)
// batch update: counter = 2 (1 * 2)

// Second click: counter = 2
// batch update: counter = 3 (2 + 1)
// batch update: counter = 6 (3 * 2)
```

In order to avoid recreating the state updater function for each state change,
which **breaks referential equality** and de-optimises a lot of consuming code,
we use a **ref** to store the **last known state** to be applied to the URL.

This is known as the [latest ref pattern](https://epicreact.dev/the-latest-ref-pattern-in-react/).

### Update queue performance

While writing this post, I realised using an array for the update queue was kind
of dumb: since each item overrides previous ones with the same key, we can use
a **Map** instead, and only iterate over available keys on update.

<Note status="success">
  This performance update was published in
  [`1.8.1`](https://github.com/47ng/next-usequerystate/releases/tag/v1.8.1).
