If you've worked with files like `package.json` or `tsconfig.json` in TypeScript
projects in VSCode, you know the benfits of having good autocompletion in your
editor.

This is powered by [JSON Schemas](https://json-schema.org/), which are JSON files
that describe the shape of other JSON files.

Using an existing schema to document a JSON file is done with the `$schema`
property, pointing to a URL to the schema file:

```json {2} title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig",
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

There is a project called [SchemaStore](https://www.schemastore.org/json/) that
lists a bunch of schemas for popular JSON files, but there are many more that are not
listed there, especially those handcrafted for specific projects, or for bleeding edge tools.

You can publish your own JSON Schema to SchemaStore via their
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md),
but you can also publish it anywhere you like, and link from there.

One example is publishing your schema on GitHub, and using the raw URL to
refer to it:

```json {2} title="sceau.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/47ng/sceau/main/src/schemas/v1.schema.json"
  // ...
}
```

<Note status="info">
  This example is taken from [`sceau`](https://github.com/47ng/sceau), a code
  signing tool for NPM packages I maintain.

## Validation

VSCode will automatically validate your JSON file against the schema, but
you can perform verification manually using the `ajv` package.

It's unfortunately not a one-liner command line trick, as AJV requires the
schema file to exist on disk first,
and [doesn't support reading from stdin](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-cli/issues/32).

You can use the following Node.js script to perform this task:

```ts title="validate.mjs"
import Ajv from 'ajv'
import addFormats from 'ajv-formats'
import fs from 'node:fs/promises'

const fileContents = await fs.readFile(process.argv[2], 'utf-8')
const jsonToValidate = JSON.parse(fileContents)
const schema = await fetch(jsonToValidate.$schema).then(res => res.json())
const ajv = new Ajv()
addFormats(ajv)
const isValid = ajv.validate(schema, jsonToValidate)
if (!isValid) {
  console.error(validator.errors)
  process.exit(1)
}
console.info(`File conforms to schema ${jsonToValidate.$schema}`)
```

```sh
node validate.mjs file-to-test.json
```

## Versioning

Another nice property of using a URL is that you can -- _and should_ -- **version**
your schema files, and the `$schema` property will act as a versioning indicator
of the JSON file that contains it.

No longer need for the following:

```json
{
  "version": 2 // What was that one about again?
  // ...
}
```

## Generating JSON Schemas

Now if have a bunch of JSON files, and you want to generate a schema for them,
you _could_ do it manually, but it's a bit tedious.

You can ask an LLM to do that for you, they are surprisingly good at manipulating
structured data, but you might need to check for hallucinations and tweak the
output a bit.
