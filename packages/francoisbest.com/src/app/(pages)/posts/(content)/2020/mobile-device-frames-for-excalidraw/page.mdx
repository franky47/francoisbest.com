I love using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) to build UI mockups. As I was
working with a client on a responsive version of their webapp, I realised that
I was always eye-balling the screen dimensions, and I wanted a way to make the
screen ratio closer to the final deal.

<figure className="mb-8">
  <MobileMockup
    role="img"
    className="dark:hue-rotate-180 dark:invert"
    aria-label="A UI mockup for a product landing page on an iPhone 8"
  />

  </figcaption>
</figure>

Figma has frame size presets for various devices, which is a great feature when paired
with responsive layouts and other design tools. None of that is needed for
mockups. It would bring unnecessary complexity to a tool that needs to remain simple,
but at least having the option to set a rectangle to the dimensions of a given
device would be cool.

So I set out to build my own library of device frames, which are simply rectangles
with the right aspect ratio for each device.

## Making Your Own Frames

We are going to use the following tools:

- [Figma](https://figma.com) _<small>(free)</small>_
- [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/) _<small>(paid, but worth every penny)</small>_

From Figma, we create a frame for a given device, say an iPhone 8, with a vivid
background colour:

![iPhone 8 frame in Figma with red background](./figma-frame-iphone8.jpg)

Copy the frame as a PNG image:

```txt
Right click > Copy/Paste > Copy as PNG
```

Then we're going to import the frame image to CleanShot:

![CleanShot > Open from Clipboard](./cleanshot-import.jpg)

Now we can use the overlay feature by pinning the frame image to the screen:

![Click the 'Pin to the screen' icon in the lower left corner](./cleanshot-pin.jpg)

import { GoLightBulb } from 'react-icons/go'

<Note title="CleanShot Feature Request" icon={GoLightBulb}>
  If anyone from CleanShot reads this post, a feature to use the clipboard image
  as a source for the "Pin to the Screen" menu action would save an extra step
  here.
</Note>

In Excalidraw, we can now position our overlay frame image and draw a rectangle
that follows the same ratio:

<video
  autoPlay
  loop
  muted
  playsInline
  style={{ marginBottom: '4rem', borderRadius: '4px' }}

  <source
    src="/img/posts/2020/mobile-device-frames-for-excalidraw/make-frame.webm"
    type="video/webm; codecs=vp9,vorbis"
  />
  <source
    src="/img/posts/2020/mobile-device-frames-for-excalidraw/make-frame.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
  <div>
    <em>
      Damn, there was supposed to be a video here, but your browser doesn't
      support it, so here's what it shows:
    </em>
    <ul>
      <li>Change the overlay opacity to 50%</li>
      <li>Move it over the Excalidraw canvas</li>
      <li>
        Select the Rectangle tool in Excalidraw and draw a rectangle around the
        frame overlay
      </li>
      <li>Position the overlay so that it fits a corner of the rectangle</li>
      <li>Adjust the other corner of the rectangle to match the ratio</li>
      <li>Voil√†!</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</video>
