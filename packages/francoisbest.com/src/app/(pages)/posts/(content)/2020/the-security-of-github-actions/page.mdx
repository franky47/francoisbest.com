[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
are a great way to build powerful customised CI/CD workflows using the power of
community-driven resources, but they can be tricky to get right in terms of
security.

## Remote Code Execution as a Service

What GitHub gave us with Actions is basically the opportunity to run
([almost](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features#actions))
any code on their servers. This makes for a large attack surface and lengthy
discussions, so let me define some boundaries.

This article is not about the kind of security regarding attacks against GitHub,
but rather against yourself, when implementing a workflow.

It will also not consider GitHub itself as an adversary, and instead focus on
threats coming from compromised third party actions and their impact on our
workflows.

## Attack Vectors

There are a few bad things that can happen to your workflow:

#### 1. Data Theft

A malicious action leaks/steals your API tokens or other secrets required by
legitimate actions.

#### 2. Data Integrity Breaches

A malicious action modifies one of your built artefacts, injecting it with
malicious code or corrupting it before it is processed or deployed by a
legitimate action.

#### 3. Availability

A malicious action crashes on purpose to prevent your workflow from executing
successfully.

## The Blessings & Curse of the Community

Having people work on their own actions and contributing them back to the
community is definitely a blessing, as can be seen with the flourishing of the
JavaScript ecosystem through NPM in the last decade.

But it comes with its woes, as we have seen in the past. Some famous examples
being the
[`leftPad` incident](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm)
(an availability _"attack"_), the
[attacks on ESLint](https://eslint.org/blog/2018/07/postmortem-for-malicious-package-publishes)
that leaked credentials (data theft) or the
[`event-stream` attack](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/180565383195/details-about-the-event-stream-incident)
that targeted Copay's build process (data integrity).

I guess every popular system will gather the interest of attackers, and in the
end the benefits will probably outweigh the risks, as long as some protections
are in place. Some are in the hands of GitHub (scanning and removing malicious
actions), but some are in the hands of the users.

So what can you do to protect yourself ?

There has been some research by
[Julien Renaux](https://julienrenaux.fr/2019/12/20/github-actions-security-risk/)
on this topic, where he recommends pinning action versions not by Git tags,
but by Git SHA-1, which is immutable.

This article builds on top of this research, looking specifically at actions
using Docker and environment variables.

## Docker-based Actions

Actions can run in a Docker container, created from an image pulled from
Docker hub or GitHub's Image Registry. You can specify a tag to use for the
image, but just like Git tags,
[Docker tags are not immutable](https://renovate.whitesourcesoftware.com/blog/overcoming-dockers-mutable-image-tags/).

As an example, I have created a small Node.js image:

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM mhart/alpine-node:slim-12

CMD node -e 'console.log("hello")'
```

```shell
$ docker build -t franky47/test:foo .
$ docker push franky47/test:foo
foo: digest: sha256:0916addef9806b26b46f685028e8d95d4c37e7ed8e6274b822797e90ae6fd88f size: 740
$ docker run --rm -it franky47/test:foo
hello
```

Later on, I modify the image, rebuild and upload it using the same tag:

```dockerfile /evil/ title="Dockerfile"
FROM mhart/alpine-node:slim-12

CMD node -e 'console.log("evil")'
```

```shell /evil/
$ docker build -t franky47/test:foo .
$ docker push franky47/test:foo
foo: digest: sha256:85fe141a80820b9db0631252ca4e06cc3ced6f662c540b9c25da645168ae5be7 size: 740
$ docker run --rm -it franky47/test:foo
evil
```

You can see how the tag transparently allows the evil version to run.
The only defence against that is, just like Git, to use the SHA-256 digest hash
to pin the image:

```shell
$ docker run --rm -it franky47/test@sha256:0916addef9806b26b46f685028e8d95d4c37e7ed8e6274b822797e90ae6fd88f
hello
$ docker run --rm -it franky47/test@sha256:85fe141a80820b9db0631252ca4e06cc3ced6f662c540b9c25da645168ae5be7
evil
```

## Docker for Action Authors

Action authors can use Docker too. They add their Dockerfile to the action
repository, and tell GitHub where to find it in the `action.yml` metadata file.
Most of the time, the job runner will build the Docker image from the sources
before running it onto the workflow.

Because those images are built out-of-band before the workflow runs, it's less
likely that the Docker build context gets injected with malicious files or
environment variables to compromise the built image. However, because the
Dockerfile and the rest of the action repository come from Git, SHA-1 pinning
is still recommended to be sure of what is being built.

#### Performance vs Security

It seems wasteful to rebuild images for every workflow run that depends
on a Docker-based action. The image may take a long time to build, and that time
is taken from the usage limits of everyone who depends on your action,
it slows their workflows down, and it generally wastes energy.

Once your action is stable, you can build and publish the Docker image, then
pin it to your `action.yml` file by digest hash:

```yaml title="action.yml"
name: Some action
runs:
  using: docker
  image: docker://franky47/test@sha256:0916addef9806b26b46f685028e8d95d4c37e7ed8e6274b822797e90ae6fd88f
```

This way, the users of your action will pull the image from the Docker registry
instead of building it.

The threat model for this kind of delivery method now shifts from your action's
users to your own workflow (the one you use to build & deploy the Docker image).
But it has a few advantages:

- You can review and pin any action you may need to build the image
- Your image cannot be compromised by being built outside of a boundary you control.

<Note title="Note">
  The threat model of the Docker registry being compromised or untrusted is out
  of the scope of this article.

## Keeping Up With The ~~Kardashians~~ Security Updates

So what about security updates ? If versions are pinned forever, we miss out on
critical vulnerabilities being patched up in the actions we use, their
dependencies and all the dependency graph.

Unfortunately for now, while security and maintenance updates of dependencies
can be automated for action authors, action users have to manually check and
update their actions, and remember to pin the SHA-1 hash every time.

Services like [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/github-actions/)
will eventually become able to analyse the dependency tree of a workflow file,
make sure with [CodeQL](https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql)
that it is free of known vulnerabilities or malicious code, and suggest updates
back to the workflow file, hopefully in the form of SHA-1 pinnings.

<Note status="success" title="2020-12-25 Update">
  Dependabot now supports SHA-1 pinning updates, when using the built-in version
  in GitHub.

Regardless of how you provide your action, there is another threat both action
authors and consumers need to be aware of:

## Environment Variables

<Note status="warning" title="2020-09-02 Update">
  What is stated in this section is no longer correct, as GitHub seems to have
  fixed the issues aforementionned.

I'm leaving the original article for reference. For a proof of fix, see the
following [GitHub issue on Docker's
action](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action/issues/10).

</Note>

GitHub Actions can communicate between one another through environment variables,
in tandem with the I/O system that GitHub provides. It's considered a feature,
but it has obvious security implications: **any environment variable exported
by an action will be part of the environment of all subsequent actions**.

This means that any action that uses the environment should consider it
potentially hostile. One example is the use of the environment for inputs when
coupled with the fact that inputs can be optional.

Let's say an action defines its manifest as such:

```yaml title="owner/repo/action.yml"
name: An action
inputs:
  foo:
    required: false
```

When used, one can optionally pass an input for the `foo` argument:

```yaml title="workflow.yml"
- uses: owner/repo@deadf00d
  name: This action does not specify 'foo'
  # Here, foo = undefined
- uses: owner/repo@deadf00d
  name: This action specifies 'foo=bar'
  with:
    foo: bar
  # Here, foo = 'bar'
```

In the first call of the `owner/repo` action, the `INPUT_FOO` environment variable
will not be defined, indicating to the action that the user did not specify
an input for `foo`, asking to use the default value.

The second call specifies a value, so the action will see
`process.env.INPUT_FOO === 'bar'`

But now if a malicious action inserts itself before those two actions, the
first call will be vulnerable to injection:

```yaml
# Yep, there's even an action to mutate the global environment:
- uses: allenevans/set-env@67961d8
  with:
    INPUT_FOO: evil
- uses: owner/repo@deadf00d
  name: This action does not specify 'foo'
  # Here, foo = 'evil'
- uses: owner/repo@deadf00d
  name: This action specifies 'foo=bar'
  with:
    foo: bar
  # Here, foo = 'bar'
```

The first call of `owner/repo` will think the input `foo` was set to `evil`,
but the second call's explicit definition will take precedence.

Unfortunately, there seems to be no defence against that kind of behaviour,
as there is no way to tell if an input environment variable comes from an
explicit definition or from the global environment of the workflow.

I contacted GitHub on Hacker One regarding that matter, proposing that
unspecified inputs be cleared of global values, their response was as follows:

> In an effort to make the CI environment as dynamic as possible,
> we've decided to allow full access to the environment and have made the
> strict security barrier lie at the ability to write to the workflow file.

#### Alternative Solution

Because the proposed solution would break existing behaviour, an alternative
could be for GitHub to define an additional environment variable that lists
the specified inputs, and to make this variable not injectable from the global
environment. This way, actions that want to protect themselves could read from
this variable, look for suspicious input variables and decide what to do.

## Practicality of attacks

GitHub limiting their liability to attacks against the workflow files
(a malicious maintainer modifying the workflow file in a sneaky pull request)
is fair enough. However I believe there are other vectors in which an action
can be compromised, without any GitHub involvement.

As demonstrated before, there are attacks on the NPM ecosystem, and
a lot of actions use JavaScript because of the convenience it brings.
A targeted attack on an action's dependency tree could go unnoticed if it
activates only in the context of a specific workflow run.

## Closing Notes

I think there is a market for automated action dependency analysis, where some
services like [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) can analyse workflows and report on
vulnerabilities, suggest actions (pun intended) via pull requests and keep a
close eye on malicious activity around GitHub Actions.
