# Hi, I'm FranÃ§ois Best

I am a developer, an [open source](/open-source) lover
and a hand-tool woodworker from France.

This is my digital garden, where I write about the things I'm working on
and share what I've learned.

## Music

I like listening to progressive metal, fusion jazz and synthwave when working:<wbr/>
syncopated beats, meter changes and arpeggios do wonders for web development. ðŸ¤˜

My favourite artists and albums of the moment:

<Note status="info">
  I used to style my apps and websites with CSS-in-JS (using
  [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)), but the introduction of React Server
  Components in Next.js 13+ helped me switch to a leaner HTML + CSS static
  render, only shipping client components where interaction is needed, while
  keeping external content (Spotify albums, GitHub repo stats etc..).
